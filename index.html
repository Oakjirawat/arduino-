        Instructables has a guide on building a basic air purifier using an Arduino Uno R3, which should be adaptable to the R4. Here's a summary:

Components:

Arduino Uno R3 (or R4)
Base shield for Arduino
Gas sensor (MQ3)
Temperature & humidity sensor
LCD1602 Display
Button
LED
Negative ion generator
Jumper wires
Cardboard box
Glass sheet
Construction:

Circuit: Connect the sensors, button, LED, and LCD to the base shield, and the negative ion generator to the Arduino.
Box: Build a cardboard box with a transparent front (glass) to observe the purification process.
Wiring: Connect all components according to the circuit diagram.
Assembly: Mount the sensors inside the box and attach the negative ion generator.
Functionality:

The gas sensor detects smoke or pollutants, and the Arduino activates the negative ion generator to purify the air. The LCD displays the gas concentration, temperature, and humidity.

Additional Notes:

The Instructables guide provides a detailed schematic and step-by-step instructions with pictures.
Consider adding a fan for better air circulation.
Experiment with different sensors and filters for improved performance.
Important:

Working with electronics can be risky. Follow safety precautions and seek help if needed.
Negative ion generators can produce ozone, which can be harmful in high concentrations. Ensure proper ventilation.

You're right to seek more information! Building an air purifier with an Arduino Uno R4 involves several aspects. Here's a breakdown to help you understand the process and considerations:

1. Understanding Air Purification:

Filtration: The most common method, using filters to trap particles (dust, pollen, etc.).
Ionization: Generating negative ions to attract and neutralize pollutants.
UV-C Light: Killing bacteria and viruses with ultraviolet light.
2. Choosing Your Approach:

Basic Filtration: Focus on a fan and filter system, potentially using the Arduino to control fan speed based on air quality.
Ionization: Incorporate a negative ion generator, potentially using the Arduino to control its operation based on sensor readings.
Combined Approach: Combine filtration and ionization for a more comprehensive system.
3. Key Components:

Arduino Uno R4: The brains of the operation, controlling sensors and actuators.
Air Quality Sensor: Detects pollutants (dust, smoke, VOCs). Consider sensors like MQ-135 or Sharp GP2Y1010AU0F.
Fan: Moves air through the filter. You can control the speed with a transistor and the Arduino.
Filter: Choose a HEPA filter for small particles or an activated carbon filter for odors.
Negative Ion Generator: Produces negative ions for air purification.
Power Supply: Provides power to the Arduino and other components.
Enclosure: A box or container to house the components and direct airflow.
4. Building Your Purifier:

Circuit Design: Connect the sensor, fan, and ion generator to the Arduino.
Programming: Write code to read sensor data, control the fan and ion generator, and display information on an LCD (optional).
Assembly: Mount the components in the enclosure, ensuring proper airflow.
5. Considerations:

Sensor Accuracy: Air quality sensors have limitations. Research and choose carefully.
Filter Effectiveness: The filter's quality determines its ability to remove pollutants.
Ion Generator Safety: Negative ion generators produce ozone, which can be harmful in high concentrations. Ensure proper ventilation.
Power Consumption: Consider the power requirements of the components.
6. Additional Tips:

Start Simple: Begin with a basic filtration system and gradually add features.
Research: Explore online projects and tutorials for inspiration and guidance.
Experiment: Test different sensors, filters, and configurations to optimize performance.

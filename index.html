        Instructables has a guide on building a basic air purifier using an Arduino Uno R3, which should be adaptable to the R4. Here's a summary:

Components:

Arduino Uno R3 (or R4)
Base shield for Arduino
Gas sensor (MQ3)
Temperature & humidity sensor
LCD1602 Display
Button
LED
Negative ion generator
Jumper wires
Cardboard box
Glass sheet
Construction:

Circuit: Connect the sensors, button, LED, and LCD to the base shield, and the negative ion generator to the Arduino.
Box: Build a cardboard box with a transparent front (glass) to observe the purification process.
Wiring: Connect all components according to the circuit diagram.
Assembly: Mount the sensors inside the box and attach the negative ion generator.
Functionality:

The gas sensor detects smoke or pollutants, and the Arduino activates the negative ion generator to purify the air. The LCD displays the gas concentration, temperature, and humidity.

Additional Notes:

The Instructables guide provides a detailed schematic and step-by-step instructions with pictures.
Consider adding a fan for better air circulation.
Experiment with different sensors and filters for improved performance.
Important:

Working with electronics can be risky. Follow safety precautions and seek help if needed.
Negative ion generators can produce ozone, which can be harmful in high concentrations. Ensure proper ventilation.
